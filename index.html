      <p> Over the last fifteen years I have developed skills in pastry and confections
        production, as well as the extreme attention to detail required. At a young age, I developed a deep culinary
        interest, and pursued a culinary career
        through high school, where I completed the highest-level culinary classes offered. I then attended Central
        Piedmont
        Community College, where I earned both the Culinary Arts and Baking and Pastry Arts degrees. During my studies,
        I honed
        my skills as a line and prep cook at several restaurants. After graduation, I worked at two country clubs as
        the pastry
        chef, I ran a chocoloate shop and also have worked at a boutique hotel. At all of those venues, not only did I
        plan, delegate, prepare and
        execute desserts, but also assisted in various stages of savory
        food preparation for high-volume banquets.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have an easy-going personality, and the ability to focus under extreme stress to complete projects at the
        highest
        standards. I also have experience in menu planning for small to large-scale banquets of up to 600 people. In
        the past,
        I have been commended by colleagues and chef instructors on my clear and concise verbal communication
        abilities,
        attention to detail, and ability to delegate based on skill levels
      </p>

      <p>
        Many skills in pastry have developed naturally for me and I have continued to
        seek out and experiment with new techniques. Of course, this all came with moments of frustration trying to
        perfect
        my pastry skills. I recognize that coding may or may not come naturally, but regardless,
        I must continue to use what I have learned in my past career in regards to planning and breaking projects into
        smaller
        tasks in order to reach the desired end goal, and also recognize there will also be moments of frustration, and
        continue seeking the latest techniques.
      </p>
